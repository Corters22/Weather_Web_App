# Web Design Challenge

In this challenge we were introduced to HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The visualizations that were used in this challenge came from a different challenge, WeatherPy. You can find the data analysis [here](https://github.com/Corters22/python-api-challenge).

### Layout

A. Home page
    This is found in the index.html in the main directory. Each visualization picture is a link to the page with a description of the chart and a conclusion of the data analysis.
